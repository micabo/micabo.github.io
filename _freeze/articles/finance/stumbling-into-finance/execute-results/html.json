it paid for food, rent, books -\nthe idea of making money by investing money seemed absurd.\n\nI recently took a _very_ introductory course on finance on [edX.org](https://www.edx.org/)\ncalled [Finance for Everyone](https://www.edx.org/learn/financial-literacy/the-university-of-michigan-finance-for-everyone-smart-tools-for-decision-making).\nAlthough the course was a bit slow-paced it still showed me, that I was missing the basics - or at least - was not aware of the implications.\nThis course ([Introduction to Corporate Finance](https://www.edx.org/learn/corporate-finance/columbia-university-introduction-to-corporate-finance)) was an excellent follow-up.\n\nLet's go over the basics.\n\n\n## Time Value of Money (TVM)\n\nLet's just assume that money does have some value.\nThe time-value-of-money is a tool to compare different ways to deal\nwith your money by bringing things you will spend/gain now and things\nyou spend/gain in the future on an equal footing.\n\nFor this article well assume a constant, positive _rate of return_ $r$ and no inflation.\n\n\n## Future Value and Compounding\n\nThe future value is a pretty simple concept everyone's familiar with.\nIf you have money in the bank the bank pays you a (nowadays very small) rate of return per period (e.g. a year) expressed in precentage.\nSo £100 today will be $£100 \\cdot (1 + r)$ one time period from now.\n\nWhen left for multiple periods $n$ the interest will _compound_: $£100 \\cdot (1 + r)^n$.\nExpressed generally, the future value (FV) of an amount today (present value, PV) will be:\n\n$$\nFV = PV \\cdot (1 + r)^n.\n$$\n\n::: {#db07a796 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nPV = 100\nyears = range(0, 11)\nrates = (0.01, 0.05, 0.10)\nFV = [[PV * (1 + r) ** y for y in years] for r in rates]\n\nfor trace in FV:\n    plt.plot(trace)\nplt.title(\"Compounding\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Time /years\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Value /£\")\nplt.legend([\"1%\", \"5%\", \"10%\"])\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](stumbling-into-finance_files/figure-html/cell-2-output-1.png){width=593 height=449}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo far so good.\n\n\n## Present Value and Discounting\n\nWe can also turn the reasoning around and calculate the present value of something we will get in the future.\n\n$$\nPV = \\frac{FV}{(1 + r)^n}\n$$\n\nThe important thing to realize is, that it allows us to **compare a future gain to a gain in the present**.\nE.g. if someone told me they'd give me £102 in one year.\nWhat would that be worth to me **now**?\nIt depends on the rate of interest.\nIf I could have £100 **now** and deposit it in a bank at 2% interest, I'd have £102 in a year.\nTherefore, the gain of £102 in a year is equivalent to receiving £100 now.\n\nWe obtained the present value by _discounting_ the future value with an interest rate we could obtain (somewhere) for the investment now.\n\n\n## Cashflows\n\nThis situation can be generalized to multiple cashflows $C_i$ (payments), to obtain the present value we simply need to discount each cashflow by the appropriate amount $\\frac{C_i}{(1+r)^i}$.\n\n$$\nPV = \\frac{C_1}{(1+r)} + \\dots + \\frac{C_n}{(1+r)^n} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{C_i}{(1+r)^i}\n$$\n\nNote that by convention the first cashflow occurs one time period from now.\nWe need to keep this in mind when applying the formula to real world problems.\n\nBased on this general formula we can derive some special cases:\n\n- Perpetuity\n- Growth Perpetuity\n- Annuity\n\n\n### Perpetuity\n\nAssume the cashflows will occur indefinitely and be constant $C$, the formula will simplify to:\n\n$$\nPV_p = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left[\\frac{C}{(1+r)} + \\dots + \\frac{C}{(1+r)^n} \\right] = \\frac{C}{r}\n$$\n\n\n### Growth Perpetuity\n\nAssume that the cashflows will occur indefinitely and grow by $(1+g)$ each time.\n\n$$\nPV_g = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left[\\frac{C}{(1+r)} + \\frac{C \\cdot (1+g)}{(1+r)^2} + ... \\right] = \\frac{C}{r - g}\n$$\n\n\n### Annuity\n\nAssume constant cashflows but a fixed time period $n$ - either we use the general formula directly or we can modify the perpetuity formula.\n\n$$\nPV_a = \\frac{C}{r} \\left[ 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + r)^{n}} \\right]\n$$\n\n\n## Examples\n\n### Value of a Bond\n\nWhat's the (present) value of a bond that will pay £50 each year for 10 years when the 'market' interest rate is 2%?\n\n::: {#e047c969 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nr = 0.02\nC = 50\n\n# using the general formula\nPV = sum([C*(1 + r)**(-i) for i in range(1, 11)])\nprint(\"£\", round(PV))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n£ 449\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhat value would the bond have, if the interest rate was higher?\n\n::: {#e75756e2 .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nr = 0.05\nC = 50\n\n# using the general formula\nPV = sum([C*(1 + r)**(-i) for i in range(1, 11)])\nprint(\"£\", round(PV))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n£ 386\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs we can see, the (present) value given a higher interest rate would be lower.\n\n\n### Value of a Loan\n\nAlice takes out a loan of £100'000 from a bank.\nThe interest rate on the loan is 5% and Alice will\npay back the money in 10 equal, yearly installments.\nWhat would she pay?\n\n::: {#45adbbd7 .cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nr = 0.05\nn = 10\n\nPV = 100_000\n\nC = PV * r / (1 - (1 + r)**(-n))\nprint(\"Payments:\", round(C))\n\n# let's double check that this would work out to\n# a PV 100'000 for the bank using the general formula\nPV_B = sum([C*(1 + r)**(-i) for i in range(1, 11)])\nprint(\"PV:\", round(PV_B))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nPayments: 12950\nPV: 100000\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo why would a bank do this?\nWell apart from not actually having to have the money they lend you, they will lend you the money for a higher interest rate than they could get investing it elsewhere.\n\n::: {#344d2380 .cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nr_A = 0.05\nr_B = 0.02\nn = 10\n\nPV_A = 100_000\n\nC = PV_A * r_A / (1 - (1 + r_A)**(-n))\n\n# let's see what that looks like for the bank\nPV_B = sum([C*(1 + r_B)**(-i) for i in range(1, 11)])\nprint(\"Value for the bank:\", round(PV_B))\nprint(\"Gain:\", round(PV_B - PV_A))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nValue for the bank: 116329\nGain: 16329\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBy lending £100'000 to Alice the bank effectively gained £16'329 in present value.\n\n\n## Summary\n\nThe TVM gives us a tool to reason about financial investments by taking time and interest into account. Payments in the future decrease in (present) value the higher the interest rate is because of discounting.\n\nThere is so much more to discuss in this space, especially risk will be an interesting thing to talk about, but more on that later.\n\n",
