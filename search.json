The ASCII encoding is a 7-bit encoding i.e. it maps the numbers from 0 to 127 (\\(2^7-1\\)) to a character.\n\nprint(f\"decimal - bit-pattern - character\")\nfor i in range(89, 100):\n    print(f\"{i:^7} - {format(i, '07b'):^11} - {chr(i):^9}\")\n\ndecimal - bit-pattern - character\n  89    -   1011001   -     Y    \n  90    -   1011010   -     Z    \n  91    -   1011011   -     [    \n  92    -   1011100   -     \\    \n  93    -   1011101   -     ]    \n  94    -   1011110   -     ^    \n  95    -   1011111   -     _    \n  96    -   1100000   -     `    \n  97    -   1100001   -     a    \n  98    -   1100010   -     b    \n  99    -   1100011   -     c    \n\n\nThe ASCII encoding contains all characters used in the English language and additional control characters such as e.g. carriage return. Nowadays, using 7-bits seems a bit odd, but this happened before a byte was standardized to 8-bits. Today the ASCII encoding looks the same, just with an additional ‘0’ prefixed to each bit-pattern."

    "text": "Extended ASCII Encodings\nAs most computers work with an 8-bit byte, people started to use the additional bit (=&gt; 128 additional bit-patterns) to encode more characters. In western Europe this resulted in encodings like Windows-1252 or Latin-1 to represent letters such as Ü (11011100 in Latin-1). In other parts of the world, other language-specific encodings arose (see for example TSCII etc.). This lead to a confusing situation where the same bit-pattern could stand for very different things.\n\nchar_as_byte = \"Ü\".encode(encoding=\"latin_1\")\nchar_as_int = int.from_bytes(char_as_byte, byteorder=\"little\")\n# note: byteorder does not matter for this encoding\nprint(f\"Ü is {char_as_int:08b}\")\n\nÜ is 11011100"

    "section": "Unicode",
    "text": "Unicode\nUnicode is a universal encoding that supports all languages, symbols and even emojis. It maps each character to an abstract unicode code point often denoted U+&lt;hexadeximal number&gt;.\n\ncharacters = ['A', 'Ü', '😆']\nprint(\"code point - character\")\nfor char in characters:\n    cp = f\"U+{ord(char):X}\"\n    print(f'{cp:^10}{char:^9}')\n\ncode point - character\n   U+41       A    \n   U+DC       Ü    \n U+1F606      😆    \n\n\nSo why do I call it an abstract code point? While the code point is a number, it does not specify how many bits are used to represent the actual characters. This is done by the Unicode Transformation Format (UTF). There are three commonly used formats: UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32. The number signifies the minimal number of bits that is used to represent a character. These formats are ‘multi-byte’ formats i.e. they may use more than one byte to represent a character. UTF-32 always uses 4 bytes, UTF-16 uses at least 2 bytes but up to four and UTF-8 uses at least one byte but up to four. UTF-32 is pretty simple to understand as it always uses 4 bytes to represent a character. The only issue arising here is byte order, which we’ll talk about later.\n\nUTF-8\nThe most commonly used Unicode Transformation Format is UTF-8, which uses at least 8 bits and is compatible with ASCII in the lower 128 characters (this is how I got away using regular Python strings which are UTF-8 encoded in the ASCII section).\nIt works by encoding the number of following bytes in the first byte (start byte). If a byte starts with:\n\n0 is not followed by any more bytes =&gt; ASCII character\n110 followed by one more byte\n1110 followed by two more bytes\n11110 followed by three more bytes\n\nThe follow-bytes start with 10.\nThe ‘payload’ in an UTF-8 encoded character is everything except the start and follow byte prefixes. Let’s look at some examples:\nThe Character ‘A’ would be 01000001 (as in ASCII). Payload = 100 0001 = U+41.\nThe Character ‘Ü’ is encoded as 11000011 10011100\nPayload = 1101 1100 = U+DC.\nThe emoji 😅 is encoded as 11110000 10011111 10011000 10000101\nPayload = 0001 1111 0110 0000 0101 = U+1F606.\n\n\nByte-Order\nOne (last?) complication arises when using multiple bytes to represent a character: Which byte should be the first byte (in a message, in storage)? Computers and protocols use different byte-orders - so-called endianness.\nIn a little-endian system the character ‘Ü’ in UTF-8 encoding would be represented as 1100 1101, while it would be represented as 1101 1100 in a big-endian system. (In my opinion the terms are a bit confusing, imho it should be call ‘little-startian’ because we start with the lowest-value byte.)\nSome programs add a byte-order mark (BOM) to the start of their files. The mark is 0xFEFF. Should a program receive a BOM as FF and FE it would know that the bytes are transmitted in little-endian order. However, this is not recommended for UTF-8 encoded files, where it can be detected without BOM anyway."

Unicode is a universal encoding that has significantly simplifed working with character encodings with UTF-8 becoming the standard format on the web.\nOne final thing I learned about Unicode is that there actually are undefined regions in the standard, reserved for private use Private Use Areas. So, not entirely unversal after all… I guess things stay interesting!"
