Hi, welcome to my site.

I will be building this website using [quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites).
My intent is to write short articles on things I stumble upon and find interesting.
These articles may just be a write-up of the material for myself, but most of the time there will be a didactic element to them.

You can also check out my GitHub [here](https://github.com/micabo).
No, it's not very up-to-date and does not contain many projects since my programming is mostly done professionally.
